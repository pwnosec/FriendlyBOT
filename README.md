User-friendly SaaS platform for 3D character design. Let's start with the basic structure and implement the main dashboard interface. We'll use React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for a clean, professional look.
```
src/types/index.ts
src/components/Navigation.tsx
src/components/ProjectCard.tsx
src/components/Header.tsx
src/App.tsx
```

I've created the initial structure for the 3D character design SaaS platform with a clean, modern interface. Here's what I've implemented:
### A responsive layout with:
- Sidebar navigation
- Header with search and user profile
- Main content area showing recent projects

### Components:
- Navigation: Side menu with main app sections
- Header: Search bar, notifications, and user profile
- ProjectCard: Display project thumbnails with collaboration info

### TypeScript types for better code organization and type safety
The interface is designed to be intuitive and professional, with:
- Clean typography and spacing
- Consistent color scheme
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

The dev server is now running, and you can see the initial interface. Would you like to implement any specific feature next, such as:
- The 3D character editor interface
- Project collaboration system
- Asset marketplace
- User authentication

### Installation Used
Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
Start application
```
